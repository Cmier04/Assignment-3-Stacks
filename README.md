# Assignment-3-Stacks

This is a program which takes in user input in the form of parenthesis and checks for balanced parenthesis by implementing a stack using a singly linked list.

Assignment was originally created on Replit but there was trouble pushing the code so work was copied and pasted into this repository. Link to original repository: https://replit.com/@cmier04/Programming-Assignment-3-Stacks
